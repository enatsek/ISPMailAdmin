ISPmail Admin 0.9.8

Purpose
~~~~~~~
ISPmail Admin allows you to comfortably manage:

- Domains: Add and remove domains (example.com) handled by your mailserver.    
- Accounts: Add and remove the email-accounts (user1@example.com) you and your
  users access with POP3(s), IMAP(s), and SMTP.
- Aliases: Add and remove aliases to these email-accounts (info@example.com as
  an alias of user1@example.com).
- Redirects: Add and remove redirects (forward emails for
  not.an.account@example.com to somebody.else@over.there.com).
- Blacklisting of e-mail addresses not to be used anymore. This is mainly for
  email addresses that have been 'burned' by having gotten into the spammers'
  address lists. Adding them to the blacklist prevents you from accidently
  creating them later again.

Praise, suggestions, and bug reports are all welcome at ima@jungclaussen.net
Check ima.jungclaussen.com for updates.

ISPmail Admin can be configured for one of three types of login:

- Only Admin: Only one user will use ISPmail Admin and that is the
  administrator.
- Only Admin without login: Same as above, but as you've protected ISPmail Admin
  behind a .htaccess username and password anyway, another login is not really
  needed.
- Admin and Users: Only one user will administrate ISPmail Admin but all users
  with an email@account may login and manage aliases for their accounts.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have setup your mailserver following the guide ISPmail by workaround.org
you already have at least MySql running on your server. ISPmail Admin is written
in PHP and therefore needs:

- Webserver: Any will do as long as PHP is supported. It must not even be on the
  same server as the mailserver database as long as it can access it.
- PHP: Any version above 5.0 (the mysqli extension is built in). I recommend the
  latest.
- MySql: Version 4.1.13 or newer, or 5.0.7 or newer.

Additionally you need

- Write access to the database: The ISPmail guide rightfully limited the
  database user mailuser to readonly. ISPmail Admin naturally needs write access
  to the mailserver database.
- Javascript and cookies:: The browser you intend to use ISPmail Admin with
  needs Javascript and cookies enabled.

Legal stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~
ISPmail Admin is "free" as in "Free beer":

- You can use it both privately and commercially for free.
- You could distribute it freely but I'd prefer if users would download it from
  here: ima.jungclaussen.com
- You can modify the code as you like and distribute that, too, but always leave
  the footer as it is:
  "ISPmail Admin by Ole Jungclaussen (http://ima.jungclaussen.com), version 0.9.

- Add the database table for blacklist (if you enabled IMA_SUPPORT_BLACKLIST) 
    CREATE TABLE `blacklist_email` (
    `id` bigint(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    `address` varchar(100) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci NOT NULL,
    `reason` varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb3 COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci NOT NULL
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_general_nopad_ci;
    --
    -- Indexes for table `blacklist_email`
    --
    ALTER TABLE `blacklist_email`
    ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
    ADD UNIQUE KEY `address` (`address`) USING BTREE;
    --
    -- AUTO_INCREMENT for table `blacklist_email`
    --
    ALTER TABLE `blacklist_email`
    MODIFY `id` bigint(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, AUTO_INCREMENT=19;
    COMMIT;


- Set the database access information (IMA_CFG_DB_ ...)

- Choose, which type of password hashes you want to use

- Set the ISPmail Admin access (login) type by uncommenting (remove the leading
  "//") the line with the method you want to use:
  * "define('IMA_CFG_LOGIN', IMA_LOGINTYPE_ACCOUNT)":
    Only one user will administrate ISPmail Admin but all users with an email
    account may login (using their password) and manage aliases for their
    accounts.
  * "define('IMA_CFG_LOGIN', IMA_LOGINTYPE_ADM)":
    Only one user will use ISPmail Admin and that is the administrator.
  * "define('IMA_CFG_LOGIN', IMA_LOGINTYPE_ADMAUTO)":
    Same as above, but when you've protected ISPmail Admin behind a .htaccess
    username and password, another login is not really needed.

- Set the ISPmail Admin administrative user and his password (IMA_CFG_ADM_ ...).
  Use a strong password, yes? Please?
